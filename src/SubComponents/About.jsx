          <p>
          Jaycee Punching Solutions Pvt. Ltd. is an offshoot of the renowned Jaycee Group, established in the early 1950s. Beginning with the business of trading of bearings, the Group today is a sprawling business with an annual turnover of over 2500 crores. Thanks to the firm commitment to deliver quality, with a customer-centric approach, the Group has expanded to several verticals and interests and is a well-known name in specialized manufacturing.
Jaycee Punching Solutions, established as a separate entity in 2009, is taking the legacy of excellence forward and is poised to be the leading player in energy solutions and electrical stamping in India.
And for good reason- with multiple state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, with world-class assembly and testing processes, only the best is delivered. As an authorized OEM for Eicher Engines (TMTL), Jaycee has manufactured and sold more than 75,000 generators in less than a decade.
